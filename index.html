 <h1>What celestial towers do originally?</h1><p class="oo">
If we see the sky, there will be many stars, the old people took groups of stars and connected them to some constellation called constellation and stayed in 88 constellations in the sky and
 Of the 88, they selected 12 constellations and named them horoscopes or sign of zodiac and the countries that are divided over the year like Pisces, Gemini and others.

<h2>Why did they choose the 12 Tower States specifically?</h2>
<p class="oo">For thousands of years after the human has remained a passion for the sky and the stars began to link the movement of criminals with his life and personality and the most important of those who worked as the Babylonians in the known division of the twelve towers and of course in the divisions other than the Chinese and Indian division.

The famous exotic towers were divided:
The twelve constellations of nations meet with them, making a virtual circuit around the sun and the earth, and each tower takes 1/12 of the circuit "30 °" so that throughout the year each tower takes a month evenly.
If we see the black image in the post, you will find that the earth and the sun, if we connect them with some line, the arrow is sold to the line with the movement of the earth.
On the basis of this division of breeds and shares consultation on the tower is attributed Les character specifications of the tower.</p>

<h3>What changed the division?</h3>

<p class="oo">The division is variable in the form that you imagined, but what happened was that they had rested their brains and took the first tower that was conceived and said that it would take a month and began preparing a month later for each tower.
In the tower of the Eve, the present is from time, but take the same place as the scorpion, because there was no account, especially that the scorpion was shining more.</p>

 <p class="oo">At the end of the post, I can say that the towers that we saw in the picture are the real ones, but they are astrologers.
And the towers as they are there is no change.</p>
