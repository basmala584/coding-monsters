                       People are all talking about what is the black hole and the greatness of taking his first picture
                      Have you ever asked yourself how we really can see an impossible need!
                      Katie bowman is a photographer and photo algorithm participating in the EHT project
                      In short, Katie worked on imaging by radio waves, not light because the plasma around the black hole emits radio waves.
                      What remains to prove Einstein's theories and equations for the black hole in this?
                      Einstein's equations predicted the shapes and sizes of the rings surrounding him, so take a picture of them, but it will not be amazing in terms of the evolution of monitoring technology, but more amazing that someone predicted him from a few mesh!
                      But, of course, to be honest, the subject is not easy to take a picture and display ... In the laws of the size of the telescopes accurately control the image you will take in the sense that all the telescope has grown all the picture was clearer .. !
                      But at the suggestion of Dr. Katy, a network was used between a large number of telescopes in different parts of the globe working to create a huge telescope called EHT or Event Horizon Telescope.

                       we noticed the color of the sun a little strange and the time of sunset length and despite the sunset, every need was still very illuminated as seen in the image of the post.
                      Everyone preferred to say that it happened rare astronomical and other, but we love to tell you in the post Almighty we speak Les!
                      After sunset every day converging that the sun is still in the sun and the world enlightened for a period + redness of the sun
                      The reason is because the sun after the sunset is supposed to disappear, but the atmosphere comes here that it works refraction or refraction of light to reflect it and you work depression or scattering of light so that it breaks the colors and because the red color has the highest wavelength, it remains closest to you.
                      Of course, we do not want to alert you and tell you that the sun sets two minutes before sunset shows you friendliness because of the refraction of light reflection and notice that the sun is set to remain fast.
                      The refraction of light depends on that the beam of light moves from space to the atmosphere ^ air ^ the refractive strength depends on the need of its name refractive index and it varies according to the intensity of air and heat and others.
                      The humidity was high in the atmosphere, it affected the light intensity, and it affected the refractive index.
                      - Provide the degree of refraction and let the sunset lengthen a couple of time.
                      Of course, the clouds had a role in the subject, the clouds at an altitude of 80 km worked dispersion of light and connected to the red color in this form.

                      The last eclipse in 2019 will remain a night in a partial lunar eclipse from 10 o'clock to 1 o'clock.
                      But the most important is why the eclipse of the moon and the solar eclipse has not been repeated every month, although the sun, earth and moon always revolve around some.
                      We must know that "the light of the moon is a reflection of the sunlight on it and the need is that the moon rotates around the earth every lunar month (every 28 days) and the earth revolves around the sun every 365 and a quarter days.
                      We think that when the earth passes between the sun and the moon, the eclipse does not. Eclipse. If all of them get one plane or the same level is not possible the moon stays above the shadow of the earth did not come on it and the sunlight conducts normal!!
                       This is really what happens that the moon is changing its angle by five degrees every period and never stayed at the same level with the Earth and the sun is twice every year ...
                      Eclipses and eclipses are not when the sun encroaches at a certain point where the hilltop (earth, sun and moon) remains on one level until one shadow falls on the second and the point is called the "meeting point of the two levels" or "knots". 346.6 days (other than the normal year) and the sun retire in the two nodes countries more than a month so as to get the necessary eclipse before or after the text of the month we see eclipse.
                      From several days he was in complete eclipse of the sun and morning became suddenly night.
